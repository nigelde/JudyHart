                <p class="bio-text">    I am a retired physiotherapist, but all my life I have loved gardening, and put some artistic effort into designing 5 gardens from scratch over the years, combining shapes, textures and colours together to try to create something beautiful.<br><br>When I was 70, living among the mountains of the Brecon Beacons, I was inspired to start painting, having had no previous experience or tuition. Within a year I had a certain amount of success, doing well in local exhibitions. I was then shortlisted for the RWA exhibition in Bristol, was hung in the design centre in London as a beginner and twice hung in MOMA gallery in Wales.<br><br>I now live in London and my style is changing...more abstract. Since moving here I have been accepted to take part in the "Artists at Home" weekend in Chiswick...for the first time ever at 83! It was a very enjoyable and successful weekend and I shall continue pushing myself for as long as I can. As I have come to art late in life with no tuition, I am anxious to try different styles of painting...so watch this space! I would be very happy to discuss a commission with anyone who would like one of my paintings.</p>
