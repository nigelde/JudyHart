                <p class="bio-text">I am a retired physiotherapist, but all my life I have loved gardening, and put some artistic effort into designing 5 gardens from scratch over the years, combining shapes, textures and colours together to try to create something beautiful.<br>When I was 70, living among the mountains of the Brecon Beacons, I was inspired to start painting, having had no previous experience or tuition. Within a year I had a certain amount of success, doing well in local exhibitions. I was then shortlisted for the RWA exhibition in Bristol, was hung in the design centre in London as a beginner and twice hung in MOMA gallery in Wales.<br>I now live in London and my style is changing...more abstract. I would be very happy to discuss a commission with anyone who would like one of my paintings.</p>
